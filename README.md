# UNOFFICIAL Stockfighter Trading API Client for Ruby
Welcome to the UNOFFICIAL Stockfighter Trading API Client for Ruby. This trading-api is based on stockfighter [documentation](https://starfighter.readme.io/v1.0/docs). It is mentioned in the documentation that lies are told (it is after all a game). This means that YMMV, if in doubt you should be able to tweak the code to work for you.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'stockfighter-trading-api-ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install stockfighter-trading-api-ruby
